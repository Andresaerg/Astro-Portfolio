    <p>
        My name is Andrés Rosales. I started programming seriously at the age of 17 when I began my studies 
        in computer engineering, even though I didn’t have a computer at the time. I am now an 
        <strong>engineer</strong> and am developing various <strong>applications with a focus on SaaS</strong>
    </p>

    <p> 
        I have collaborated with various people and entrepreneurs to provide <strong>efficient</strong> 
        solutions that <strong>simplify, speed up, and secure</strong> the workflows of some 
        <strong>SMEs</strong> and anyone who needs them, thus enhancing the daily lives of many people.
    </p>
