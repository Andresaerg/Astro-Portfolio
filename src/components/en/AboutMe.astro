    <p>
        My name is Andrés Rosales. I started in programming in depth at the age of 17, 
        when I began my studies in computer engineering without even having a computer. 
        I am now an <strong>Engineer</strong> and am <strong>developing various applications with 
        a projection to SaaS</strong>.
    </p>

    <p> 
        I have managed to collaborate with various people and entrepreneurs to provide 
        <strong>efficient</strong> solutions that make the workflow of some <strong>SMEs</strong> 
        and anyone who needs it <strong>simpler, faster, and safer</strong>, 
        thus facilitating the day-to-day life of many people.
    </p>
